This repo contains examples of how to implement [Protovalidate](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate) in `Golang` and `Dotnet`.

protovalidate is a library that can be used to enforce rules on Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages.

It allows you to define validation constraints directly within your .proto files using custom options. These constraints can then be automatically checked at runtime to ensure that the data conforms to the specified rules.

To learn more about my experience with Protovalidate you can check out my blog [here](https://conalldalydev.medium.com/how-to-implement-business-logic-in-proto-contracts-d5e850d776ad).
